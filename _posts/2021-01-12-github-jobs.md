# Goal of the project

Using the Github jobs api build a frontend for it using React and new hook API. All the data will be consumed from github's jobs api end point.

# Tools used

- React
- Bootstrap
- Axios
- react-markdown

# Outcomes

- Learned to use react framework and its new hooks api.
- make request to REST endpoint and how to consume data on the frontend.
- how to handle pagination on frontend.
- learned to render the markdown with react.
- using bootstrap framework.
- genrate production build of react app.
- deploying it to github pages.


# My thoughts after it

- React makes it very easy to generate highly interactive webpages.
- react hooks are really good, but are bit different in working that class components.
- there are minor pitfalls that should be handled correctly when using the useEffect hook.
- using context with hook is really easy and should be preferred rather than reaching out to libraries like redux when you need global state for you app.
