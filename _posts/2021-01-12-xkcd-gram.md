# Goal of the project

Build Instagram like infinite scroll UI for XKCD cartoons using React and Browser APIs. The goal is to build easy to use Instagram like UI for XKCD comics so that everyone can explore all the comics without having to hit next and previous buttons.

# Tools used

- React
- Chakra UI
- Fetch
- Intersection Observer

# Outcomes

- Learned to use react framework and its new hooks api.
- make request to REST endpoint and how to consume data on the frontend.
- how to use Browser intersection observer API.
- Working with closures.
- generate production build of react app.
- deploying it to github pages.


# My thoughts after it

- Be Careful when dealing with javascript closures, they can go unseen sometimes and cause weird effects in your app.
- Learn more about browser APIs, Some of them are really useful and can mitigate use of third party library in your app.
- Learn about Portals in react when you want to render modals.
- Learn about lazy loading of images.
