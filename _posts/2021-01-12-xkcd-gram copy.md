# Goal of the project

A pokemon card game where you can build you own team of pokemon. The end goal is to learn styling using components, using intersection observer and making beautiful UI with chakra UI.

# Tools used

- React
- Chakra UI
- Fetch
- Intersection Observer

# Outcomes

- Learned to use react framework and its new hooks api.
- make request to REST endpoint and how to consume data on the frontend.
- how to use Browser intersection observer API.
- Working with closures.
- using events in reacts.
- generate production build of react app.
- deploying it to github pages.


# My thoughts after it

- Be Careful when dealing with javascript closures, they can go unseen sometimes and cause weird effects in your app.
- Learn more about browser APIs, Some of them are really useful and can mitigate use of third party library in your app.
- Learn about Portals in react when you want to render modals.
- Learn about lazy loading of images.
